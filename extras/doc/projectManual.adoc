== The Server Client

=== The server at a glance

This server was created as part of a group work in our course AvG (Automatisierung von Geschaeftsprozessen, Automation of business processes).

=== The WebSocket API

The server provides (amongst other of APIs) a WebSocket API for sending messages to the frontend and receiving messages from the frontend.

=== The Jakarta Messaging API

the server also sends buy/sell orders to a message broker app and receives stock update messages from the same broker.

=== The Business Logic

The created orders get persisted inside of a service object. Incoming orders with updated status get merged with existing orders that have the same order id.
